# Overview
For this assignment, my colleague X and I worked on parts 1 and 3, which involve different types of analysis as outlined in the project description. Hereâ€™s a brief look at how we approached these tasks.

# Part 1: Technical Analysis
In this part, we focused on analyzing stock data to identify trends and signals that could help with decision-making. We applied different indicators to historical stock price data over various time periods, using available tools to assist with the calculations.

# Part 3: LSTM Stock Price Prediction
For part 3, we built a predictive model to forecast stock prices. We prepared the data, trained the model, and used it to predict future stock movements. We also evaluated how well the model performed by testing its accuracy against the data.
